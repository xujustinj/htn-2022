["Thrust faults are a type of fault that form along the boundary between two tectonic plates.","The term \"thrust fault\" was coined by the geologist John Tuzo Wilson in the 1930s.","Thrust faults are named after their characteristic geometry, which is a result of the force of the tectonic plates pushing against each other."]
