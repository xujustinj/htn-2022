A state funeral service will be held at Westminster Abbey on 19 September 2022 at 11:00, followed by a committal service later that day at St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle. The Queen will be interred in the King George VI Memorial Chapel at St George's. The occasion of her state funeral will be a national bank holiday in the UK.",

Waterloo had 150 kilometres (93 mi) of trails by 2007, as compared to 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) of trails in 1987. In 1988, a trail network comprising 135 kilometers of trails connecting neighborhoods was proposed. The 5-kilometre (3.1 mi) Iron Horse Trail, connecting Waterloo and Kitchener, opened in 1997. Then-mayor Joan McKinnon brought upon the connection of the Trans Canada Trail into the Waterloo Region, which ran from the Iron Horse Trail to Waterloo's northern boundary.The 76-kilometre (47 mi) Walter Bean Grand River Trail, announced in 1999, served to create an accessible trail along the Grand River. Waterloo: An Illustrated History, 1857–2007 states,  \"[the trail] was particularly needed in Waterloo as the river's geographic location on the edge of the city meant that, unlike so many other Canadian cities, the river had not historically played a central role in the community.\"",
